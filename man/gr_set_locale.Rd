}

}
\details{
Note to Linux users: the desired locale may not be installed on the system. A list of available locales can be obtained in bash terminal:

\code{locale -a}

Russian locale is \code{ru_RU.UTF-8}, and Ukrainian locale is \code{uk_UA.UTF-8}. If absent in the list, then install the desired locales by:

\verb{sudo locale-gen ru_RU.UTF-8}

\verb{sudo locale-gen uk_UA.UTF-8}

\verb{sudo update-locale}

Then restart R session, and localization should work as expected.
